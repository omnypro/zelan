# Zelan Project Notes

This directory contains documentation and notes about the Zelan project. The notes are organized to provide clear context for development.

## Structure

- **[PROJECT_STATUS.md](./PROJECT_STATUS.md)**: Current state of the project, completed work, and in-progress items
- **[ROADMAP.md](./ROADMAP.md)**: Future development plans in priority order
- **[ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md)**: System architecture details, components, and interactions
- **[TROUBLESHOOTING.md](./TROUBLESHOOTING.md)**: Common issues, error reference, and debugging guidance
- **[DEVELOPMENT_NOTES.md](./DEVELOPMENT_NOTES.md)**: Technical notes on implementation details, decisions, and trade-offs

## Using These Notes

These documents are designed to provide context for development conversations. When starting a new session:

1. Review **PROJECT_STATUS.md** to understand what's been done and what's in progress
2. Check **ROADMAP.md** for upcoming priorities
3. Refer to **TROUBLESHOOTING.md** when encountering errors
4. Use **ARCHITECTURE.md** for understanding system design

We strive to keep these documents updated as the project evolves.
