# Zelan Implementation Plan

This document outlines the implementation steps for converting the Zelan Tauri desktop application to a containerized API service.

## Phase 1: Core Infrastructure

- [x] Set up new project structure
- [x] Create basic configuration system
- [x] Set up Docker configuration
- [x] Create error handling foundation
- [ ] Implement core event bus
- [ ] Implement service management

## Phase 2: Authentication System

- [ ] Implement token manager
- [ ] Create OAuth client for Twitch
- [ ] Implement API key management
- [ ] Create authentication middleware for API
- [ ] Set up secure storage for tokens and keys

## Phase 3: Adapter Implementation

- [ ] Migrate base adapter interface
- [ ] Implement HTTP client abstraction
- [ ] Migrate Twitch adapter
  - [ ] Implement Twitch API client
  - [ ] Implement Twitch EventSub client
  - [ ] Implement Twitch authentication
- [ ] Migrate OBS adapter
- [ ] Implement test adapter
- [ ] Add adapter recovery system

## Phase 4: WebSocket Server

- [ ] Implement WebSocket server
- [ ] Create client subscription system
- [ ] Implement authentication for WebSocket connections
- [ ] Add event filtering
- [ ] Create serialization caching for performance

## Phase 5: API Development

- [ ] Set up API routing
- [ ] Implement adapter management endpoints
- [ ] Create event history and statistics endpoints
- [ ] Implement configuration management API
- [ ] Create authentication endpoints
- [ ] Add Swagger documentation

## Phase 6: Testing & Documentation

- [ ] Add unit tests for core components
- [ ] Create integration tests
- [ ] Add example clients
- [ ] Write API documentation
- [ ] Create usage documentation
- [ ] Write deployment guides

## Phase 7: Optimization & Deployment

- [ ] Optimize performance
- [ ] Add metrics collection
- [ ] Implement proper logging
- [ ] Create production-ready Docker composition
- [ ] Add health checks and monitoring
- [ ] Create CI/CD pipeline

## Migration Strategy

### Code Reuse

The following components will be reused from the existing Tauri application:

- Adapter interface and implementations
- Event bus logic
- WebSocket server core
- Authentication logic

### Breaking Changes

The following areas will require significant changes:

- Configuration storage and management
- Authentication flow (from device code to standard OAuth)
- Plugin system (removal of Tauri plugins)
- UI integration (replacement with REST API)

### Migration Tools

A migration script will be provided to:

1. Identify existing configuration
2. Export tokens and settings
3. Convert to the new format
4. Set up initial configuration

- Phase 3: 2 weeks
- Phase 4: 1 week
- Phase 5: 2 weeks
- Phase 6: 1 week
- Phase 7: 1 week

Total estimated time: 9 weeks
