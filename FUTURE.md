# Zelan Future Development Roadmap

## Completed Items

### ✅ 1. Replace Polling with Twitch EventSub

The Twitch adapter now uses EventSub instead of polling, which:
- Provides real-time event notifications
- Reduces API usage and latency
- Is more efficient and reliable than polling
- Delivers events immediately when they occur

### ✅ 2. Consolidate Token Management

Token management has been centralized through a dedicated TokenManager that:
- Provides a single source of truth for token state
- Handles secure token storage and retrieval
- Manages token refreshing
- Offers a unified interface for all adapters

## Current Priorities

### 1. Implement a Robust Error Recovery System

The error handling needs improvement for better reliability:

Recommendation: Add a comprehensive error recovery system:
- Implement retry policies with exponential backoff for different error types
- Add a circuit breaker pattern for persistent failures
- Classify errors by type (network, auth, rate limit) and handle each differently
- Enhance logging with more detailed error contexts
- Improve error reporting in the UI
- Create a centralized error registry for easier debugging

### 2. Add Comprehensive Testing Suite

The codebase needs better test coverage for reliability and maintainability:

Recommendation: Implement a complete testing system:
- Create unit tests for all adapter components
- Add integration tests for end-to-end flows
- Implement mocks for external APIs (Twitch, OBS)
- Add automated testing for authentication flows
- Create a CI pipeline for continuous testing

### 3. Enhance WebSocket Client Support

Better client libraries would improve the developer experience:

Recommendation: Create client SDKs for different languages:
- Develop a JavaScript client library for web overlays
- Create a simple Python client for integration with other tools
- Add TypeScript types for all events
- Implement reconnection logic in clients
- Add examples of common integration patterns

## Future Enhancements

### 4. Improve Documentation

Better documentation would make the project more accessible:

Recommendation: Enhance documentation coverage:
- Create comprehensive API documentation
- Add more examples and quickstart guides
- Document the event schema for consumers
- Create tutorials for common integration scenarios
- Add troubleshooting guides

### 5. Implement Proper Data Persistence

The current approach to storing configuration and tokens could be improved:

Recommendation: Enhance data persistence architecture:
- Create a structured database (SQLite) for configuration
- Implement proper migrations for configuration changes
- Add versioning to stored settings
- Create a backup/restore system for user configuration
- Use a transaction-based approach for all storage operations

### 6. Add a Pluggable Extension System

A plugin system would allow for more flexibility and extensibility:

Recommendation: Create a plugin architecture for adapters:
- Implement a proper plugin system for dynamic loading
- Allow third-party adapters to be installed
- Create a standardized API for all adapters
- Add a plugin marketplace or directory
- Support hot-reloading of adapters

### 7. Implement Advanced Event Processing

The event system could be enhanced with more powerful features:

Recommendation: Enhance the event system:
- Add event filtering based on type/source
- Implement event transformations (combining, splitting)
- Create an event history with searchable logs
- Add event replay capabilities for debugging
- Support for conditional events and complex routing

### 8. Add Better Diagnostics and Monitoring

Better monitoring would improve troubleshooting and reliability:

Recommendation: Create advanced diagnostics:
- Implement a performance monitoring dashboard
- Add detailed metrics for API calls, event throughput
- Create visualization of event flows
- Add system health checks with alerts
- Implement periodic connection testing for all adapters

### 9. Improve UI/UX

Enhancing the user interface would make the application more user-friendly:

Recommendation: Enhance the user experience:
- Create a more intuitive configuration interface
- Add real-time status indicators for adapters
- Implement a dashboard with event visualization
- Add theme support (light/dark mode)
- Improve responsiveness for different screen sizes

### 10. Add Deployment and Update Mechanisms

Better deployment options would make the application easier to distribute:

Recommendation: Enhance deployment capabilities:
- Add auto-update functionality
- Create installers for multiple platforms
- Consider containerization options
- Implement a headless mode for server deployments
- Add configuration export/import

This roadmap addresses both immediate improvements and long-term enhancements, with a focus on making Zelan more robust, developer-friendly, and extensible.
