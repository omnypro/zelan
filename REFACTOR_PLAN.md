# Zelan Refactor Plan

## Implemented Enhancements

### 1. Enhanced Error Recovery System

#### Implemented:
- Created a comprehensive error classification system with categories (Network, Authentication, RateLimit, etc.)
- Implemented RetryPolicy for automatic retries with exponential backoff and jitter
- Added CircuitBreaker pattern to prevent cascading failures
- Created ErrorRegistry for centralized error tracking and analysis
- Added RecoveryManager to coordinate error recovery strategies
- Implemented AdapterRecovery trait for adapter-specific recovery strategies
- Integrated with TwitchAdapter for robust error handling

#### Benefits:
- Improved resilience against transient errors
- Better handling of rate limits and timeouts
- More detailed error logging and categorization
- Centralized error tracking for debugging
- Automatic retry with intelligent backoff for different error types
- Circuit breaker protection against persistent failures

#### Next Steps:
- Add UI components to visualize error statistics
- Apply recovery strategies to more areas of the application
- Create adapter-specific error recovery policies

## Planned Enhancements

### 2. Comprehensive Testing Suite

#### Plan:
- Create unit tests for all adapter components
- Add integration tests for end-to-end flows
- Implement mocks for external APIs (Twitch, OBS)
- Add automated testing for authentication flows
- Create a CI pipeline for continuous testing

### 3. Enhanced WebSocket Client Support

#### Plan:
- Develop a JavaScript client library for web overlays
- Create a simple Python client for integration with other tools
- Add TypeScript types for all events
- Implement reconnection logic in clients
- Add examples of common integration patterns
