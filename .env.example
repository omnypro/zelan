# How to obtain Twitch credentials:
# 1. Go to https://dev.twitch.tv/console/apps
# 2. Log in with your Twitch account
# 3. Click "Register Your Application"
# 4. Fill in the application name (e.g., "Zelan")
# 5. Add "http://localhost" as the OAuth Redirect URL
# 6. Select "Application Integration" as the category
# 7. Click "Create"
# 8. You'll receive a Client ID - copy it to this file
# 9. No client secret is needed as we use Device Code Flow

# Important notes:
# - The application uses Device Code Flow, which is suitable for desktop applications
# - Only the minimum necessary scopes are requested (user:read:email, channel:read:subscriptions, etc.)
# - Tokens are securely stored with encryption
# - You can revoke access at any time from your Twitch account settings
