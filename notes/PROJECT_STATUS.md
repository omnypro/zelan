# Zelan Project Status

This document provides a high-level overview of the current project status, including completed work and ongoing efforts.

## Completed Work

### Backend Enhancements

1. **HTTP Client Abstraction**
   - Created `HttpClient` trait with `SimpleHttpResponse` for standardized responses
   - Built `ReqwestHttpClient` for real HTTP requests
   - Implemented `MockHttpClient` for testing
   - Added request history tracking for verification in tests

2. **TwitchApiClient Refactoring**
   - Refactored to accept an injected HTTP client
   - Created comprehensive tests with mock responses
   - Implemented environment-independent testing approach
   - Added test-specific methods that bypass environment variables

3. **Error Recovery System**
   - Created a comprehensive error classification system
   - Implemented RetryPolicy with exponential backoff and jitter
   - Added CircuitBreaker pattern to prevent cascading failures
   - Created ErrorRegistry for centralized error tracking
   - Implemented AdapterRecovery trait for adapter-specific strategies

4. **Token Management**
   - Centralized through a dedicated TokenManager
   - Implemented secure token storage and retrieval
   - Added token refreshing management
   - Created a unified interface for all adapters

5. **Twitch EventSub Integration**
   - Replaced polling with EventSub for real-time event notifications
   - Reduced API usage and latency
   - Implemented more efficient and reliable event delivery

### Frontend Improvements

1. **Component Architecture**
   - Split monolithic App.tsx into modular components
   - Created component hierarchy (Dashboard, Settings, etc.)
   - Implemented desktop-style UI components
   - Added StatusIndicator with visual feedback

2. **State Management**
   - Replaced multiple useState calls with useReducer pattern
   - Created typed actions for state updates
   - Implemented proper TypeScript interfaces for all data
   - Removed any types throughout the codebase

3. **Custom Hooks**
   - Created useTauriCommand for backend communication
   - Implemented useAdapterControl for adapter operations
   - Added useDataFetching for data retrieval
   - Created useAppState for state management

## In Progress

### Authentication Testing
- Basic state transition tests implemented
- Token restoration error handling tests added
- Need tests for token refresh flow
- Need tests for error recovery paths
- Need tests for edge cases and timing-sensitive code

### Backend Simplifications
- Implementing error builder pattern
- Converting ErrorRegistry to use VecDeque
- Simplifying CircuitBreaker implementation
- Extracting authentication to separate components

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Authentication Testing**
   - Finish token refresh tests
   - Implement error recovery tests
   - Add edge case tests

2. **Finish Backend Simplifications**
   - Simplify token recovery logic
   - Consolidate retry logic
   - Improve error context

3. **Add Integration Testing**
   - Create tests for error handling
   - Test adapter lifecycle
   - Test event bus propagation
